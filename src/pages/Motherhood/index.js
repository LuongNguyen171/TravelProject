            content: `“Are you going to have another?”, asked a well-meaning family member, out of the blue. Another cup of coffee? Another what? It could have been anything, but I knew exactly what they meant. Another baby. The question that fills me with dread.

            It seems like when your first child enters toddlerhood, there is a societal expectation, or assumption, that all mothers are yearning for the next one. For me, that couldn’t be further from the truth.
            
            Why assume there will be a next one? For many, one is enough.
            
            After extreme prematurity, neonatal surgeries, a 3.5 month NICU stay, post natal anxiety, PTSD and a global pandemic, motherhood has well and truly consumed me, challenged me and changed me.
            
            I feel like there is so much we still have to experience with Theo. He is a healthy and happy little boy ready to see the world. But it’s not just about Theo.
            
            I am working hard on my own personal development and having further therapy for my trauma. I am healing and reconnecting with parts of old myself. I want to write a book! I am unapologetically making myself a priority again.
            
            Having another baby is not a priority right now, and perhaps it never will be. All I know is that this little boy and his Daddy complete me and they are all I need.
            
            Now that restrictions are slowly lifting, we are ready to start living our best life and making memories that go beyond the local playground, as a family of 3.
            
            Female adult life isn’t all about having babies. There is so much more available to us now.
            
            Please always be careful when asking people about their family plans. You don’t always know what they’ve been through, or are going through.
            
            Have you ever been asked a similar question and how did you deal with it? I’d love to know.`,

            title: 'A Review of the Micralite ProFold Pram',
            comments: 0,
            date: '06/12/20',
            content: `As Theo grew from a baby to a toddler, I decided that it was time to move on to smaller, lighter and more nimble every-day pram. We had been using our Joolz Day3 ever since Theo came home from hospital, and the transition from its bassinet to front facing seat was seamless. However, at around 20 months, I realised that Theo no longer needed such a cumbersome pram frame and that it was time to reclaim my car boot space! Cue the Micralite ProFold.

            I was attracted to the Micralite ProFold for three main reasons. I thought it was sleek and aesthetically pleasing, but I also loved that it went into a horizontal position for naps and also was compact enough for a plane cabin. It weighs 7kg, is suitable for use from birth to 15kg and retails at £275. Read on for my full Micralite ProFold review.
            
            To say how light and compact the Micralite ProFold is, the seat positioning is incredibly versatile. We also own a Babyzen YoYo and I have always been frustrated by how even the most upright position is very ‘slouchy’. My son Theo got frustrated with it as he wanted to sit more upright and see the world.

            By comparison, the Micralife ProFold can be adjusted to a more upright position and on the other end of the spectrum, it also goes horizontal. Personally I think the vertical seat positioning is a huge plus point of this pram as its perfect for when your little one needs a nap on the go (great for days out, weekends away and holidays). The foot rest also kicks up into a flat position, so your child can comfortably lay flat out in the land of slumber.
            
            Another huge plus point of the Micralite ProFold is how compact it is when collapsed. Compared to the Joolz Day3, it takes up a tiny amount of space in my boot and is small enough to fit in most plane overhead lockers. The benefit of this is that you can take the pram through the airport with you and into the plane cabin, rather than having to check it in as a piece of luggage. I know we aren't travelling very much at the moment but it’s certainly worth considering for the future!
            
            In terms of design, I would say the Micralite ProFold has both style and substance. We have it in Graphite which is a lovely grey shade that looks super stylish with the brown details. As well as its curb appeal, the pram has thoughtful features such as a built in pocket under the handlebar (perfect for parents phones, keys, purse). I also really like the clear window on the pram roof / canopy as it means parents can glance down and check on their child very easily.

            It pops up and collapses in one quick, easy movement, which makes life that little bit easier (watch my Instagram reel for a demo). It feels like its a pram that has been designed by parents, for parents. The Micralite ProFold also has suspension so it is a smoother ride than the Babyzen YoYo.

            There are two things I have found about the Micralite Profold that could definitely be changed and improved. Firstly, the foot break is positioned in a way that makes it easy to accidentally kick when you are walking. The result is that I often find myself accidentally putting the pram into break mode as I am walking along, which is not very nice for your small passenger. Another design fault is that the padding around the straps is not fixed with any velcro, meaning that the padding can easily slide off when the harness is not clipped in. For this reason we have ended up taking the padding off so we don't lose it.

            Despite these design glitches, I would still recommend the Micralite ProFold and think that it has a huge amount of great features to offer. I think the price is really reasonable and you can trust that you are getting a high quality pram with style and substance.

            The Micralite ProFold retails at £275 but is currently on a cyber month offer with micralite.com for only £150.`,

            content: `Hey guys! I’m excited to share some big news. I’ve got a job! It’s an amazing communications role at a national UK charity.

            Since 2016, running The Travelista has been my full time job and sole source of income. I have travelled the world through a job that I created, and I could not be more proud of this. However, my life evolved when I became a Mum and suddenly and traumatically (15 weeks earlier than expected) my lifestyle totally changed.
            
            Then Covid came along. My blog earnings took a hit and the summer lockdown with a young toddler was difficult to say the least. I was left feeling burnt out and desperate for a bit of structure. I also craved some financial certainty. I realised what I needed and went looking for it, in the middle of a pandemic.
            
            I am proud to be a working Mum and I am pleased to say I feel like I have designed the ideal working scenario for myself now. But fear not, The Travelista isn’t going anywhere!
            
            The new job is part time so I work 3 days a week for the charity and have the rest of my week to dedicate to Theo and do bits for The Travelista. I spend some evenings and Sundays working on blog content, but only if I want to. I don’t put any pressure on myself. The result is that I am enjoying my content creation so much more. As a part time employee and a small business owner, I sort of feel as though I now have the best of both worlds.
            
            I am learning so much in the job and although I work from home, I feel so much more connected to the outside world. Its very nice to be part of a team again and feel like I am making a difference for a charity with a very good cause. So far the job has been very good for my mental health.
            
            After totally losing myself in the first year of motherhood, this is a really positive step for me and one that I thought was worth celebrating. So that’s one good thing to come out of 2020.
            
            Now, tell me one positive thing that has happened to you in 2020? `,

            comments: 2,
            date: '04/10/20',
            content: `Last month we bravely loaded up the car and set off on the 6 hour drive from Leeds to North Devon, with our 22 month toddler in tow. This holiday was our Plan B after our flights to Spain were cancelled due to Covid. I was really happy with the Plan B we had come up with and was looking forward to getting away and to experiencing Devon for the very first time.

            Joining us on holiday were my parents / Theo’s grandparents, making us a party of 5. We were all supposed to be going to Spain together, so naturally we all made a new plan together. They are really helpful and hands-on with Theo, so I was very glad to have them with us. Here's what we got up to on our wonderful family holiday in North Devon.
            
            A TODDLER FRIENDLY HOLIDAY IN NORTH DEVON
            DAY 1 - WALKING TO LEE VILLAGE AND LEE BAY
            After the 6 hour drive turned into a horrific 8+ hour journey from hell, we wanted our first full day in North Devon to be as relaxing as possible. We spent the morning getting our bearings on the farm, and Theo got to feed the resident goats, sheep and donkeys.

            In the afternoon we took the public footpath from Lower Camp Scott Farm to Lee Bay, which is the closest beach to our accommodation. The route of the bridle path is stunning and takes you through a magical woodland and through the pretty village of Lee (the village pub The Grampus is great to stop for a drink in the beer garden, but the food isn’t anything special).

            Lee Bay is definitely worth a visit, but its worth mentioning that it’s not a beach. It’s an enclave of rock pools and little pools of water, that children will love exploring. Theo loved dipping in and out of the rockpools, but it did also feel very hazardous for a toddler. Theo had a blast, but Mum and Dad didn’t find it very relaxing! From Lee Bay you can take the beautiful coastal paths to Ilfracombe and Woolacombe.

            DAY 2 - COOMBE MARTIN DINOSAUR AND WILDLIFE PARK
            On Day 2 we booked tickets in advance for Coombe Martin Dinosaur and Wildlife Park. The park interestingly spreads across two woodland valleys. The setting is beautiful, but the many steps and ramps means that it’s not ideal for a pram (although not impossible). The best part of the park was definitely the Dinosaur valley. The mechanical dinosaurs were very lifelike (especially to children) and the setting felt very ‘Jurassic park’. For children who are seriously into their dinosaurs, a walk through the valley would be wildly exciting.

            I was a lot less impressed at the wildlife valley, as the enclosures looked very tired and in need of some upkeep and the animals all looked a bit sad. I wouldn’t recommend the wildlife valley, but you can only buy a ticket for general admission, rather than for the dinosaur valley only. There’s also an amazing indoor soft play area included in the admission price, so I would still say it’s worth a visit.

            We spent about 3 hours at the park we went straight to Coombe Martin Bay which was a quick 5 minute drive away. It’s a lovely beach, but it doesn’t have the soft golden sands of nearby Woolacombe and Croyde. The beach is quite shingly so it’s worth getting some jelly shoes for little ones. There is public parking right by the beach which was really handy, and Coombe Martin itself is a pretty little village with cafes and shops.
            
            DAY 3 - WOOLACOMBE BEACH AND DINNER AT THE JUBE
            Day 3 was set to be a September scorcher (reaching 26 degrees) so we decided to spend a full afternoon at Woolacombe Beach. This was my favourite day of the holiday by far, mainly because of the weather and because of how much Theo adored the beach. He was so happy and content playing in the sand and exploring. The ‘surf’ was also amazing on this day so Mum and Dad also got to have fun in the sea with a Boogie board. Woolacombe is 4.8km long and very wide, so there was plenty of space for him to run around without getting close to other groups.`,

            content: `As many of you will know, prematurity is now a topic very close to my heart after my own son Theo was born prematurely at 25 weeks. As well as posting about travel and motherhood, I also try to raise awareness about prematurity whenever I can (particularly on my Instagram). But today I am glad to raise awareness on my blog and to spread the word about 'Soothing the Smallest', a fantastic campaign between Sudocrem and premature baby charity Ickle Pickles.

            SOOTHING THE SMALLEST
            Every year, 1 in 8 babies are born prematurely, that’s 100,000 babies every single year. Just like Theo, these babies need to spend weeks, sometimes months, in neonatal care units before they are strong enough to leave. Neonatal intensive care costs the NHS thousands of pounds every day and many hospitals do not have the equipment to care for extremely preterm babies.

            This autumn, Sudocrem and premature baby charity Ickle Pickles are teaming up to raise funds for the vital neonatal equipment premature babies so desperately need. In honour of the partnership a new, limited edition pot of ‘My Ickle Sudocrem’ has been created and will be sold in Boots and Tesco stores across the UK for six weeks from the 26th of August. Each sale of the ‘ickle pot' will mean 50p donated to Ickle Pickles. An historic event for the brand, Sudocrem have never before adapted their classic packaging for a charity campaign such as this. A typical ventilator costs £25,000, the equivalent of 50,000 little pots.

            content: `Last weekend we had our first night away from home since the UK lockdown began. We went to Cleethorpes for the weekend and had an overnight stay at Theo’s Nannies house. It felt so nice to pack our bags and get away. It was also the perfect opportunity to try out our new Sleep & Go Lite travel cot by Micralite. The original Sleep & Go cot is a clever travel cot is a 3-in-1 bassinet, travel cot and playpen. The Sleep & Go Lite works in exactly the same way, but without the newborn bassinet. Here’s my review of the Sleep & Go as a Mum of a very active 17 month old. I hope you this post helps you find the right travel cot for you.
            
            MICRALITE SLEEP & GO LITE TRAVEL COT REVIEW
            LIGHT AND COMPACT
            Firstly, I love how light and compact the Sleep & Go Lite is. It comes neatly stored in a black zip bag with handles, meaning you can throw it over your shoulder whilst carrying other bits. It fit easily into the boot of our car, although being 88cm in length, it wouldn’t fit into a suitcase. If you were flying with this travel cot it would need to be a standalone piece of luggage.

            THE SET UP
            Once we arrived at the in-laws, I went upstairs to put the travel cot up. Having played around with the cot before at home, I already knew it was super easy to set up. It’s literally a case of sliding it out of the bag, and standing the legs out until you hear the ‘click’ to confirm they’re safely in place. Then you just insert the padded mattress which also comes in the bag. Watch my IGTV below to see how easy it is to put up.

            I would say that the mattress is quite firm but still comfortable and does the job. We forgot to bring a fitted sheet for the mattress but the material is wipe clean so we didn’t have to worry too much.

            COLLAPSING DOWN
            We found it just as easy to put the Sleep & Go down as we did to put it up. All you need to do is find the black buttons on the frames to collapse the legs. It all folds back into a streamlined shape ready to slide into the storage bag.

            GREAT FOR PLAY TIME
            It’s really handy that the Sleep & Go can also be used as a play pen and in hindsight I could have been using it for this purpose throughout lockdown. It also has a plastic coated bottom so you could use it in the garden.

            CHOOSING BETWEEN THE SLEEP & GO ORIGINAL AND THE SLEEP & GO LITE
            Just to be clear, the Sleep & Go Lite (£135) does not come with the insert bassinet or a zip down side for play time. This makes it ideal for older babies (6 months+) and toddlers who wouldn't need the bassinet. The original Sleep & Go is a little more expensive (£169.99) but comes with the newborn bassinet and zip down side. Other than those differences, they are very similar and operate in exactly the same way.

            I think the zip down side is a great feature when using the travel cot for play time, especially as your child gets older. I think it's a shame this feature isn't included on the Sleep & Go Lite as well.
            
            THE VERDICT
            For us, the Micralite Sleep & Go travel cot ticks every box. It’s both stylish and functional, with various uses as your baby grows. It’s unlikely we’d ever need to fly with it so the length is not an issue for us. Its safe and sturdy, even when housing a boisterous toddler!`,

            title: '6 Things to Avoid Saying to a Mum of a Premature Baby',
            comments: 1,
            date: '27/07/20',
            content: `I have had many a conversation with fellow mums of premature babies and it seems to be a common theme that we’ve all been on the receiving end of some quite hurtful comments. These comments aren’t meant to be hurtful, but they still hurt. They could easily be said by a friend or family member who has the best intentions, but they show a definite lack of understanding of what we are going through or have recently been through. I’m writing this post to raise awareness about what a mum of a premature baby goes through and if this post helps to stop one insensitive comment to a fellow mum then it will have done its job 🙂

            5 THINGS TO NEVER SAY TO A MUM OF A PREMATURE BABY
            1. “AW, HES SO TINY”
            He’s not tiny. He’s absolutely huge compared to the 800g he was. You have no idea of the blood sweat and tears it’s taken for him to reach 6lb.
            
            2. “AT LEAST YOU DIDN’T GET ANY STRETCH MARKS”
            I had this one and I was actually lost for words. No, we didn’t get stretch marks, but that would have been such an obscenely small price to pay in exchange for having a healthy term baby.
            
            3. “YOU’RE LUCKY YOU SKIPPED THE HARDEST PART OF PREGNANCY”
            We would have done anything to have had end stage of pregnancy. We feel robbed of our pregnancies. We had to grieve our pregnancies. Getting to experience a smooth, term pregnancy is not a given. It’s an absolute privilege.
            
            4. “DON’T YOU JUST MISS THE NEWBORN DAYS?”
            No, we don’t. When our babies were newly born we were away from home. We lived in a hospital. We expressed 8-12 times every 24 hours. We were separated by an incubator and held our babies once a day and only if they were well enough.
            
            5. “HOW AMAZING IS THAT FIRST HOLD?”
            It wasn’t amazing. It was terrifying. Most Mums wait days and even weeks to hold their premature baby (I waited 9 days). When we first hold them, they’re covered in tubes, tapes and wires. We’re scared to move. That magical moment of holding your baby after birth is another privilege that was taken away.
            
            6. “CONGRATULATIONS! IT’S A BOY / GIRL!”
            I know they’re such kind gestures but receiving ‘it’s a boy’ cards and gifts felt uncomfortable and too soon. Especially in the first 6 weeks when we didn’t know if he would survive. It’s far from a time of celebration. I did receive a few ‘thinking of you’ cards and they felt much more comforting and appropriate.
            
            A female consultant said Congratulations to me a few hours after Theo was born and I was speechless. I didn’t know if my baby was going to live or die. After a few seconds I said ‘I don’t think Congratulations is the right word’. She later apologised to me and thanked me for telling her.
            
            3 Things You Could do / Say to a Mum of a Premature Baby

            I’m so sorry this has happened. I can’t imagine what you’re going through but I am here for you every step of the way
            You are still the single most important person in your babies life 
            What can I bring you to make your days a little easier? You could suggest bringing a home cooked meal, freezer meals, new toiletries or to do some washing or household tasks.

            date: '10/05/20',
            content: `Whilst all is quiet on the travel front, I’ve been working on this bumper blog post of all the best baby products I’ve found since becoming a Mum. Some of the products we bought before Theo was born, so this may help anyone working out what to buy for a newborn. Some of the products we bought further down the line when we began to wean and transfer Theo into his own cot. Everything listed in his blog post is currently in my house and, at some point, was used every single day. I know how overwhelming shopping for a new baby can be, especially when its your first, so I really hope this post comes in handy for new parents and parents to be. Like many new parents, Amazon has been a total god send for us and its where we've bought almost all of this stuff. You can trust everything has been tried and tested by me, a first time Mum.

            The items have been liked to on Amazon and put in age-appropriate order, starting from newborn items and moving through to toddler items. A few of the items within the list have been gifted, but most of the items we have bought ourselves after research and advice. I love every product that is featured in this post. 
            
            THE BIG TICKET ITEMS
            Cribs, prams and car seats are a good place to start for a newborn shopping list, but I know the amount of choice can feel totally overwhelming. Different products are right for different people, but the following products were perfect for us.
                    
            SNUZ POD BEDSIDE CRIB
            Theo slept in a SnuzPod 3 in our room until he was about six months old (following UK sleep safety guidelines). There are lots of different bedside cribs on the market and I remember doing a lot of research on them at the time. We went for the SunzPod 3 and I have absolutely no regrets. The best feature about the Snuzpod 3 is that you can lift off the bassinet and easily move it around the house. This means it can double up as a safe place for your baby to sleep downstairs through the day.
                    
            JOOLZ DAY3
            Choosing the pram was about the only thing we did before Theo’s early arrival. Now at 18 months old, we are still using the Joolz Day3 every day. We started with the newborn bassinet until around 7 months and then switched to the more up-right pram fitting. The great thing about the pram fitting is that it has 3 angles and can go completely flat for naps. Read my full review of the Joolz Day3 here. The Day3 is Joolz' latest model from the Day collection and retails at £899.99 at John Lewis.
                    
            JOOLZ NURSERY BAG
            We also got the Joolz nursery bag in the same colour in the pram (ours was ‘Amazing Grey’). I loved that the bag perfectly coordinated with the pram and it came with attachments that hook onto the pram with ease. Its spacious with lots of compartments. The best features are the changing mat and the isolated section to keep liquids cool / warm.
                    
            JOIE 2-IN-1 SWING
            When we realised how soothed Theo was by being rocked in his car seat, we wanted to find a seat to mimic the same movement. Theo was around 4 weeks old when we bought this swing and it was an absolute game changer. He napped in this beautifully throughout the day and it gave him a safe and stimulating place to spend time if I needed to leave the room. It rocks in two directions at various speed settings, plays music and vibrates. I was so happy with this product and highly recommend.
                    
            FIRST CAR SEAT: MAXI COSI PEBBLE I-SIZE (NEWBORN TO 1 YEAR OR 13KG)
            Of all the choices in the world of baby products, I found the car seat the most overwhelming. There is just so much choice and its such alien territory. We bought the Maxi Cosi Pebble for Theo's first car seat as it was strongly recommended by my friend. It met all the latest i-size safety requirements and the additional insert made it snug and safe for our tiny preemie. At the same time, we also bought the Maxi Cosi FamilyFix i-Size isofix base. This car seat is rear facing in line with safety guidance.
                    
            MAXI-COSI FAMILYFIX ONE I-SIZE ISOFIX BASE 
            The car seat slots into the isofix base very easily and there is a traffic light system on the base to alert you if the car seat isn't fitted properly. The good thing about this base is that its compatible with some second stage car seats too, so you should only need one isofix base until the baby is around 4 years old.
                    
            SECOND CAR SEAT: MAXI COSI PEARL (9KG TO 18KG)
            We were very happy with the Maxi Cosi brand so wanted to stick with it for Theo's second car seat / toddler car seat. The Maxi Cosi Pearl is one of the car seats that is also compatible with the Family Fix isofix base, so it was a bit of a no brainer for us. This car seat will last Theo until he is around 4 years old or 18kg. The good thing about the Pearl is that it can be rearward and forward facing in the FamilyFix isofix base.`,

            title: 'Why I’m Supporting the Huggies ‘Tiniest Footprint’ Mission',

            content: `Since becoming a Mum, I have been so conscious of all the extra waste that having a baby generates. Whether that be from nappies, baby wipes or food packing, it’s quite astounding how someone so small can still have such a big impact on household waste. I recycle as much as I can and always try to shop the most sustainable products, but I’m not perfect. I know that the most convenient options are often the least eco-friendly; baby wipes being one of them.
            
            That’s why I am proud to be supporting Huggies in their ‘Tiniest Footprint’ mission, which aims to eradicate plastic from their entire baby wipe range within 5 years, or sooner. They want to provide the gentlest skincare for babies whilst leaving the smallest environmental impact. At present, their wipes already contain up to 50% less plastic than other leading brands so they’re already well on their way to their plastic-free goal. I was amazed to learn that by using Huggies wipes, you can reduce plastic usage by the equivalent of 63 plastic bottles a year! That is pretty amazing and it’s small changes like this that can add up to a big difference.

            Show your support and you could win a one-month supply of Huggies wipes (12 packs). All you need to do is post a photo of your baby’s feet on Instagram with the hashtag #HuggiesTiniestFootprint and my handle @thetravelista in the caption. Here’s my entry below.`,

            title: 'A Whitby Mini Break with Baby',
            comments: 1,
            date: '31/10/19',
            content: `Last month we experienced our first little family holiday with baby in tow. I had plans to hop on a plane with Theo when he was a few months old. But Theo’s prematurity threw us a huge curveball and plans changed. Instead, we’ve decided to work our way up to an overseas trip next year by doing some UK staycations first. Living in Leeds, I wanted somewhere in close driving distance that would still feel like a nice escape. Being by the sea and only 1 hour and 20 minutes drive away, a Whitby mini break was an obvious choice for us.

            Our base for our 3 night Whitby mini break was the Rose and Crown Yard cottage, which we booked via cottages.com (read my review of the cottage here). I loved the look of the nautical interiors, the baby-friendly amenities and the fact that is was right in the heart of Whitby town. Being so central, it also meant that we were only a few minutes walk away from the harbour and 10 minutes from the beach.
            
            DAY 1
            After taking some time to load up the car with all our stuff (including a ridiculous amount of baby paraphernalia), we were en route to Whitby and crossing the beautiful North York Moors. Luckily, Theo slept the whole journey. We followed the sat nav directions to our holiday cottage, which was tucked away down a historical alley way off of Whitby’s Flowergate. I loved the hidden and quickly location of the cottage, which was a surprise even for me.
                    
            After getting settled in the cottage, we went for a little stroll around Whitby Harbour. I hadn’t visited Whitby for about 10 years, and it had been even longer for Scott. We put Theo in the baby carrier and got our bearings during golden hour. The light against the water was beautiful and I started to feel myself relax into our little break. As Theo’s usually in bed by 7pm, we grabbed a fish and chips takeaway from The Magpie for dinner and it didn’t disappoint. Anyone that visits Whitby has to try The Magpie’s famous fish and chips.
                    
            DAY 2
            I woke up excited for our plans to take Theo swimming for the first time at Raithwaite Coastal Retreat. The pool is located in the spa area, so it was lovely and warm for Theo’s first swim experience. He loved the water and it was such a joy to see him splashing around and take it all in. We also stopped for lunch at The Brasserie and I enjoyed a 30 minute back, neck and shoulder massage in the spa. It was such a treat!
                    
            By mid afternoon we were back at the cottage so we decided to put Theo in the carrier and walk up Whitby’s famous 199 steps to Whitby Abbey. It felt amazing to explore the cobbled Whitby streets with Theo comfortably in tow. We took in the views of Whitby Harbour from the cemetery and took a stroll around the Abbey. The 199 steps is one of the most iconic parts of Whitby.
                    
            DAY 3
            On the final day of our Whitby mini break we went for a long walk along Whitby Beach, with Theo in the carrier again. The trip definitely made me realise that exploring with a baby has to be done at a much slower and more leisurely pace, but that’s OK with me! We rounded off our final day in Whitby with an early dinner at Trenchers, which holds the prestigious title of best fish and chip restaurant in the UK in the 2019 Fish and Chip Awards. I opted for a fish pie which was delicious and Scott went for the famous fish and chips which he raved about.
                    
            TOP TIP: A carrier is an absolute must for anyone visiting Whitby with their baby. It’s the perfect way to carry your baby around and means you don’t have to tackle the beach, steps or cobbles with a pram.
                    
            Whitby isn't far from home but it gave us all a much needed dose of adventure and escapism. It also gave me the change to feel like a travel blogger again. I loved how this trip made me feel; like a new, better version of my old self. Still a travel blogger, just with a baby in tow.
